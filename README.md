# jsfun
This tool started as a way to help with Python programming, but has expanded rather a lot! The main tool is [Python Display tool](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/pythoncopy)

## CS Specific tools

* [Binary Conversion tool](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/binaryconvertor.html)
* [binary quiz](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/binaryquiz.html)
* [iGCSE File Size Calculator](https://ians.site/file/) (Student created)
* [Python Challenges](https://pythonchallenges.weebly.com/) (Welcome to use challenges, but entries are GIS only)

## Fun tools
There is now a host of little tools that enable you to enter in some text or links and then use the results. In most cases, the link updates so that you can easily come back.

* [triangle](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/triangle.html) discussion tool
* [Diamond 9](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/diamond9.html)
* [3D Lollipop Stick Carousel](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/lollipop.html) - For choosing random names, groups or questions
* [Tile Reveal Game](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/imgtiles.html) - Link an image and play a game to see who can guess what it is first
* [Image Reveal](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/imgrev.html) - Fun spotlight to investigate an image. Great for younger children to explore.
* [Image Compare](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/imgcomp.html) - A tool to see two images over the top of each other. Great for Now & Then or even just comparing which you like best.
* [Plot Device Chooser](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2261416/fullscreen/) - In Scratch

## Python Display Tool Features

A [display tool](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/pythoncopy) that will enable you to download Python files as either .py files or .txt files if your firewall is very restrictive.
It enables you to choose dark mode or light mode and it enables you to go full-screen. 

For code under 20 lines it will make a puzzle too! 

## How to use

![Raw file](https://i.imgur.com/TT0mVo8.png)

Click on [Python Code Display Tool](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/pythoncopy) You can then add a url to raw gist file. such as: 
[https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jamesabela/53cc928fd03720c0803839b31bcda287/raw/635a2c7b12a1a6af75623d65d41889e8e1bbce96/average.py](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jamesabela/53cc928fd03720c0803839b31bcda287/raw/635a2c7b12a1a6af75623d65d41889e8e1bbce96/average.py)

It will then update with the new url. To embed this into your own site, just add the final url that appears: 

e.g. [https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/pythoncopy?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jamesabela/53cc928fd03720c0803839b31bcda287/raw/635a2c7b12a1a6af75623d65d41889e8e1bbce96/average.py](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/pythoncopy?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jamesabela/53cc928fd03720c0803839b31bcda287/raw/635a2c7b12a1a6af75623d65d41889e8e1bbce96/average.py)

You can display nearly any Python file you choose, make a Parsons puzzle of the first 20 lines and get step by step display from [Pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/python-compiler.html#mode=edit)

## Why download a text file?
Some school firewalls don't allow you to download .py files, because they are executables, so this ensures they are not.

## Advanced use
Use ?url= to add the site you want. It needs to be a raw Python file. 

Example:
https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/pythoncopy?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jamesabela/cf6a0c1725a3212dedd77657911f2a63/raw/964efc7fc9df266ebe5f2826d97fe719868dc62b/pi.py

For up to 20 lines you can use the reordering quiz. It uses the same format:
https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/reorder?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jamesabela/ce1a69f05f78fa56fbd03a4f31d13978/raw/4ff44e44fae1192081ebed6f793fd34ae68c1d6d/grocer.py
Simply use ?url= and the url you want to display.

You should be able to use any file on github and probably other sites too. I've put some of the [common algorithms](https://gist.github.com/jamesabela/53cc928fd03720c0803839b31bcda287) for iGCSE below as a tester.

## Triangle Discussion Tool
A [triangle](https://jamesabela.github.io/jsfun/triangle.html) discussion tool is a tool used in English language learning to get discussion going. It encourages you to discuss which is the most important word and why. It can lead to some wonderful open ended discussons and they sometimes get quite deep! Here are some computer science themed triangles. The random button will generate more general discussions on common topics.
